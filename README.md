# Cheetah-detection-from-thermal-images
Information about changes in the population sizes of wild animals is extremely important for conservation and management. Wild animal populations have been estimated using statistical methods, but it is difficult to apply such methods to large areas. To address this problem, we are trying to developed several support systems for the automated detection of cheetah detection from thermal images. In this project we are going to use the cheetah dataset provided by roboflow team, then an object detection algorithm, performed to detect object of interest from thermal remote sensing images
